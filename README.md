The ipython notebook Binary Oracle contains the code used to run the experiments with binary classifiers presented in
Section 5.1. The results of these experiments are contained in the folder binary_oracle

The code for the deep learning experiments is found in experiments_dl.py. The results of these experiments are contained
in the deep_learning experiments folder.

Some of the code used in these experiments was taken with permission from Nicholas Carlini. In particular, the files
l2_attack.py, setup_mnist.py, and train_models.py were modified from the repository https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks
